# eg_coin_flip
This is a demo repo to get started on the coin flip game. The HTML and CSS are valid, but the JS doesn't work. Most code has been stripped out and replaced with comments and pseudo-code explaining what effects to achieve.

To use this, download the files, rename the project (and the page title). For the HTML, replace anything you want, but keep in mind that the buttons are triggering functions in the JS file.

I've included a CSS reset and some very basic styles. You'll want to add your own styles, especially to visually indicate when things have changed or what their status is. For example, making a win glow.

In the JS file, I've included at the top all the general tasks, and in the comments below that, detailed step by step comments of what code should go where. That said, you might find it easier to just write your own JS in a different file and refer to this one for info. Just be sure to change the file path in the index file so that your new JS file is being loaded!
